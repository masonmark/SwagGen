# SwagGen (this fork)

2018-08-13

The [https://github.com/masonmark/SwagGen](https://github.com/masonmark/SwagGen) fork of [SwagGen](https://github.com/yonaskolb/SwagGen) is a temporary, project-specific fix for a couple specific issues with Swift 4.2, and is expected to be obsoleted in the near future.

Once a subsequent release of SwagGen is updated for Swift 4.2, and  [#48 Use StencilSwiftKit instead of Stencil](https://github.com/yonaskolb/SwagGen/issues/48) is fixed, this fork will be abandoned.
